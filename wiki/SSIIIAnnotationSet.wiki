#A draft set of required, recommended, and optional Dublin Core metadata elements to be used to annotate SSIII ontologies

[http://dublincore.org/ Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Home Page]

[http://dublincore.org/2010/10/11/dcelements.rdf# Dublin Core RDF (DC-RDF) document]


= SSIII DC Element Set =

These elements would be in addition to available RDF/OWL annotations, including:  rdfs:comment, owl:deprecated, owl:incompatibleWith, rdfs:isDefinedBy, rdfs:label, owl:priorVersion, rdfs:seeaAlso, owl:versionInfo

A versioning narrative will be added as an rdfs:comment in the form of a change log.  Detailed versioning information will be captured at the ontology level using owl versioning constructs.

We can establish a version URI/IRI to specific version tag in Subversion.  Create a version PURL that will point to the SVN repository to a particular tag.
