#summary This page captures the issues that came up and decisions made in developing these ontologies.

= Introduction =

  * The WMO document used is the Version 1.0 Draft which clearly is not a final draft as it is full of editorial notes.  We will have to revisit these ontologies as the document is updated.

== Seaice-form Ontology Notes ==

 * The definitions under "Ice of land origin" are complex and inter-related.  Only where there was a clear non-overlapping distinction of a class hierarchy were sub-class relationships used.  Otherwise, all terms were just entered at the same level.  
    * For example, Iceberg Tongues held together by fast ice would consist not only of "Ice of land origin" but also "sea ice."  However, the WMO nomenclature puts Iceberg Tongues under "Ice of land origin" and so did I.  
    * On the other hand it was pretty clear from the definition that "Glacier Ice" includes glaciers and icebergs, so I did make "Glacier Ice" a superclass of those two items.
    * Similarly, "Ice Island" really has two definitions depending on hemisphere; but at this point we have no need to separate the two classes and the WMO doesn't (yet) so I left it as a single class.
    * In some cases, there isn't really a good definition of a term in the WMO documentation.  In these cases, see for example "Tabular Berg," and additional comment with a suggested definition was added to the ontology.
    * It looks like growlers and bergy bits will end up with floe sizes - such is proposed in the definition, so I gave them both hasFloeSize.  This may be a bit odd, since hasFloeSize for "Sea ice" only goes down to 20 m, which these items suspiciously have floe sizes smaller than that, indicating that while they are put in "ice of land origin" they might also be sea ice...?
