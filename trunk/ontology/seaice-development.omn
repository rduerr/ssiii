        rdfs:comment "The sea ice terms that this measure is based on are a bit misleading.  The terms themselves (e.g., first-year ice, second-year ice, etc.) refer to years; but actually what the terms are based on are consecutive ice melt and ice growth seasons.  These seasonal concepts are loosely coupled to time in the sense that every year has them; but saying that something is for example first-year ice only indicates that it developed during one ice growth season and hasn't lasted through a ice melt season yet.",
