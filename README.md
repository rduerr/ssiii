Version 2 of the SSIII sea ice ontologies is currently in the Ontologies/v2 directory, though at this point all of the ontology references still use purl.org URL's (which also died during this time) with redirects to the google code site.  A release of the ontologies with these problems fixed will be created in the near future.

In addition, code to create LOD triples from sea ice chart data in SIGRID 3 format from the v2 ontologies is included is available.

Version 3 of the ontologies should be available by the end of September, 2016.
