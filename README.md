These files were automatically exported from code.google.com/p/ssiii to this site when Google pulled the plug on Google Code.  

Version 2 of the SSIII sea ice ontologies is currently in the Ontologies directory, though at this point all of the ontology references still use purl.org URL's (which also died during this time) with redirects to the google code site.  A release of the ontologies with these problems fixed will be created in the near future.

In addition, code to create LOD triples from sea ice chart data in SIGRID 3 format is included.

Version 3 of the ontologies should be available in a bit over a month.
